# CS 1XA3 Project02 - Salehh6

## Overview
This webpage is Hishmat Salehi's custom resume created from dhpark's template. Custom animation features are added to this resume (e.g. Darkmode, color changing bars, etc.) to draw attention of the reader.

## Javascript/JQuery features
### Feature 1: Dark/Light themes
Description: There is a button at the top of the webpage that says either Dark Mode or Light Mode, that switches the webpage's theme to Light or Dark mode. 

Benefits: As a programmer I spend a lot of time on screen, having Dark mode doesn't hurt my eyes as much as light mode.

Fun Fact: Dark mode saves battery and helps save the environment.

### Feature 2: Color changing bars
Description: By moving your cursor on the bars that represent how skilled I am in a certain skill, the bar changes color to a randomly generated color.

### Feature 3: Magnifying text
Description: By moving your cursor on any text after the summary, the text's font size increases. i.e. The website is equipped with a Magnifying text feature.
